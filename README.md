Food2Feed - An Android App for Food Donation

Overview:

Food2Feed is an innovative Android application designed to address the issue of food wastage while simultaneously helping those in need. Our platform connects people who have surplus food with organizations that can distribute it to those less fortunate. The app facilitates the donation process by enabling users to easily request food donations and ensure that surplus food is collected, tested for quality, and safely delivered to NGOs for distribution.
